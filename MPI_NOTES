This branch contains the very first prototype of MPI enabled
within-chain parallelization and the second generation which uses a
more mature code base.

The second generation requires use of the stan-math branch
feature/concept-mpi. This version uses the files marked with a "2" in
their file names (oral_2cmt_mpi2.stan and mpi_defs2.hpp in
examples/mpi).
